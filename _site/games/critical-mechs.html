<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This game was a first-person multiplayer co-op game that puts players into various puzzling levels. The players have to work out how to co-operatively proceed through the puzzles all the while with the eventual goal to be the sole winner.</p>

<p><strong>To solve the puzzles you must work together.</strong>
<strong>But to win, you must defeat everyone.</strong></p>

<h2 id="post-mortem">Post Mortem</h2>
<hr />

<p>This game I would also consider a failure, not to be hard on myself or the team. But objectively. The game didn’t achieve its goal of being a ‘first-person multiplayer co-op game’. While the multiplayer worked okay and the concept of ‘Solve the puzzles you must work together’ and ‘defeat everyone to win’ might have been there to me it still felt like a failure. The fact that it took so long (a couple of months) to produce what I would now be able to put together in less than a week; in hindsight is very funny :)</p>

<p>This was the last game in the Production Teams class. The goal of this class was to quickly concept and build prototype games game-jam style. This was game jam 4/4 and as the subject drew to a close, as seen in Frantic Food Frenzy the project lost momentum quickly.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the game jam period, I had a number of personal commitments that made me unavailable for a few days. And I had to miss a meeting. I made sure to catch up. But I think once again it got to the point where things were moving, just really slow. Everyone wanted to just forget the bad things that weren’t getting done. The curse of the sugar coat strikes again here.</p>

<p>The process of development if I recall went something like:</p>

<p>Blockout the basic scene.</p>

<p>Build the turret (that didn’t work anyway :)</p>

<p>Get the shield buttons working
Linking them to the exact ring they are supposed to spin.</p>

<p>But ultimately I couldn’t get the feel of the scene quite right, I had such a limited amount of time and it caused me a great deal of frustration.</p>

<p>At the same time, the designers were working on two other vastly different levels.</p>

<p>An arena-style capture the flag level.</p>

<p>A bit of a maze kind of level where the players must open doors for each other.</p>

<p>As you can see it was kind of all over the place and its a miracle we even got as far as we did.</p>

<p>Overall, as you can see the project was kind of directionless and definitely a massive reason it wasn’t successful, with eager and naive developers on a cool idea it was a very interesting time.</p>

<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What Went Wrong?</h2>
<hr />

<p>This project had no clear direction, even when I knew what I had to do. I found myself doing the majority of the work as the designers had yet to complete any subjects about the engine or implementing even basic mechanics.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to be present in meetings due to some personal commitments towards the end of the project and given I’d completed a lot the work no one really knew what they needed to do - they were kind of lost. I did my best to communicate even when I was away and always made sure the technical documentation was descriptive enough to outline what I’d done, but the other team members didn’t have enough time so they probably didn’t read the documentation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it’s still great looking back and seeing what even a failure can look like, the idea itself had all the makings of a successful game. And i’d one day like to give it another try with my team.</p>
