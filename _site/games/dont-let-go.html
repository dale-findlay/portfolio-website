  <li>To really sell an idea not only must the idea be good, but a strong presentation backing really helps make the concept tangible and more far reaching to your target audience.</li>

<h2 id="post-mortem">Post Mortem</h2>

<p>This game was one we put together as part of our production planning class where we were given a small amount of time to come up with an idea as a team and pitch it to the teachers.</p>

<p>This one was one of my favorites looking back, as its really a pretty lame idea, but it still looked like it had potential and it’s taught me a lot about what it means to have design language and creating a visual style for a game - something that has helped me so much now.</p>

<p>I put together a quick and dirty logo which gave the pitch presentation a massive leg up over all the others in the group.</p>

<p>I wish I still had the Prezi link for this one because I remember it being quick a cool and funny pitch presentation taught me a lot about what makes a good presentation and putting together some quick assets like the ones above was a great idea gave the project a tangible and started to create a bit of language around how the game worked.</p>

<h3 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong?</h3>

<p>I don’t know that anything really went wrong here. From the notes i have still lying around from the first actual pitch everyone on the team spoke clearly and fluently.</p>
