## **Overview**
<hr>
A dog walking simulator where your goal as a dog walker is to stop the dog from finding one or more distractions.

### Languages & Skills Used:
* Public Speaking
* Planning a presentation
* Creating a game concept
* Building artistic mockups.
* Creating a visual style

### What I learned (in a nutshell):
* To really sell an idea not only must the idea be good, but a strong presentation backing really helps make the concept tangible and more far reaching to your target audience.
* A strong belief in a idea can help alleviate the public speaking anxiety.

## Post Mortem

This game was one we put together as part of our production planning class where we were given a small amount of time to come up with an idea as a team and pitch it to the teachers.

This one was one of my favorites looking back, as its really a pretty lame idea, but it still looked like it had potential and itâ€™s taught me a lot about what it means to have design language and creating a visual style for a game - something that has helped me so much now.

I put together a quick and dirty logo which gave the pitch presentation a massive leg up over all the others in the group.

I wish I still had the Prezi link for this one because I remember it being quick a cool and funny pitch presentation taught me a lot about what makes a good presentation and putting together some quick assets like the ones above was a great idea gave the project a tangible and started to create a bit of language around how the game worked.

### What went wrong?

I don't know that anything really went wrong here. From the notes i have still lying around from the first actual pitch everyone on the team spoke clearly and fluently.
