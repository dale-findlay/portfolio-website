## **Overview**
<hr>
Relativity is a first-person shooter action puzzle game, where you must race against the clock the collect the cubes and climb the tower as fast as possible beat your personal best and youâ€™ll earn your spot on the leaderboard.

### Languages & Skills Used:
* Unity C#
* 3D Modelling
* Material Creation
* Texture Creation
* Creating a visual style
* Defining a games design language.
* Building the game on my own :(

### What I learned (in a nutshell):
* Over-scoping can kill a project dead in its tracks.
* Project management is important to keep a project moving!
* Throwing more programmers at a problem will never fix underlying issues.
