## **Overview**
This game was a open-world third-person driving-sim type game where the aim of the game is to collect the ingredients and cook the recipe before reaching the target destination.

## **Post-Mortem Breakdown**

Ah, this one probably over all of them made me the.  This was group project, comprised of 3 programmers (myself included), 3 designers and  artists.

To put it frankly, this project fell apart and fast. We had a very successful prototype showcasing the real possibility of a producible game.

But, after riding the high of our game being the 'best' in group. We pushed our scope bigger and bigger until eventually it overwhelmed the team. However - i done think it was so much scope more so lack of enthusiasm, this was towards the end of a very tumultuous nearly 3 year course where the light at the end of the tunnel was closing in, but the reality that the advanced diploma meant so little in the real world was also looming. All eventuating in an all around slump in performance i must admit i felt the same lack of enthusiasm for sure.

### **Production Build One**

The first 'production' build of the game was pretty good. At this point it was really just taking what we had from our first build and translating into a fresh project. However, at this point we'd taken on a new programmer and he was tasked with the sole responsibility of the car. As you can see, it wasn't great and needed a lot of work - a far cry from what i'd crashed together in the prototype build.

### **Production Build Two**

All the while, the C# scripts kept pilling up and the 'backend' of the recipe system needed a redesign. I stepped up to this task and the new system did a pretty good job, taking the data from some in house tools i'd built so the designers could easily change the recipes on the fly. And john doe programmer had improved his car script a bit more. The game was starting to come together again!

A massive new addition to this build was a main menu i built in a bit of an effort to get everyone a bit more excited for the game.

Along side it - a first pass logo i put together to help the team get hyped up about our game and it worked.

### **Production Build Three**

Now, moving in high gear the project seemed to hit a stand still. With the addition of a basic mission system - the main aspect of the game, the driving really wasn't feeling right and i think it had everyone questioning whether or not the game was worth even finishing. Nonetheless we all moved on, assessment deadlines looming ever closer progress was happening.

As a last minute effort to bump up our build i threw together a park in the city center with some models made up by the artists.

By this point once again, the games core mechanics were taking shape, an even better version of the car happened.

### **Production Build Four**

With yet again, the stress heating up, we finally managed to get the core mechanics working in a complete way Start Mission to a Complete Recipe.

The car had been yet again updated. It was really looking like we we making progress.

### Production Build Five And Final!

**IMG TIMELINE**

But as everyone elses subjects where taking far to much time out of their lives nothing was getting done on this project. Basically no changes were made for a really long time and on top of that, artistically the game took a step in the wrong direction (in my opinion) the car's new model wasn't really what the game needed and it a long with a few other factors caused the game to fall into the development hell spiral.

All this leading to build 5. The 'final' shall we say build of the game.

### What Went Wrong?
In my opinion the number one reason the project ultimately failed was **lack of leadership**. There was very little in the way of 'leadership' from the teachers and the times they did it often manifested it self in sugarcoated bs that ultimately wasn't constructive - basically choosing the 'good' parts of the build and focusing on that and just brushing off some major concerns. 

This project would have benefitted massively from a creative director or project manager who's one and only job was to be the creative visionary of the project. There were individuals who naturally floated to the top of their streams like myself in the programming stream by way of designing the fundamental systems of the games, and a fantastic designer who called the shots when it came to design expanding on the concept pitched. But without a central force i think the two streams diverged too some pretty irreparable distances, not in terms of 'direction' but communication and also motivation.

Another major contributor was the fact that everyone had a bunch of subjects right at the end that needed to be rushed as they transitioned the course to the new curriculum so everyone was stressed.

It's a really great example of how a project can fail and has taught me so many lessons in the ways of being a good leader, being a good team member and also further developing my skills as a game programmer.

But, overall it was a very positive experience in hindsight, im now working with some of the very same people on our own project that is slowly but surly coming together.
